# Implementation Status

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure - COMPLETED

### What We've Built

1. **Core Types & Interfaces**
   - `src/core/types/UserState.ts` - Complete user state management types
   - `src/core/types/FlowContext.ts` - Flow execution context interface

2. **State Management System**
   - `src/core/storage/StateStorage.ts` - Abstract storage interface with Memory & File implementations
   - `src/core/session/SessionManager.ts` - Complete session lifecycle management

3. **Flow Architecture**
   - `src/core/flows/BaseFlow.ts` - Abstract base class for all flows
   - `src/core/flows/FlowRouter.ts` - Intelligent message routing system

4. **Flow Implementations**
   - `src/flows/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.ts` - Complete 2-step onboarding (coin creation + username collection)
   - `src/flows/qa/QAFlow.ts` - Q&A handler for questions and conversations
   - `src/flows/management/ManagementFlow.ts` - Coin/group management commands

5. **Enhanced Message Coordination**
   - `src/core/messaging/EnhancedMessageCoordinator.ts` - Upgraded message coordinator with flow integration

6. **Main Integration**
   - `src/main.ts` - New main entry point integrating all components

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Two-Step Onboarding Flow
- **Step 1:** Collect coin name, ticker, and image
- **Step 2:** Collect usernames/addresses with fee splitting
- Supports equal splits and custom percentages
- Validates input and resolves addresses
- Guides users through each step with contextual responses

### ✅ Session Management
- Persistent user state across conversations
- Automatic new user detection and onboarding initiation
- Progress tracking through onboarding steps
- State storage with both memory and file backends

### ✅ Intelligent Flow Routing
- Automatic detection of user intent
- Routes new users to onboarding
- Routes questions to Q&A flow
- Routes management commands to management flow
- Fallback handling for edge cases

### ✅ Enhanced Message Coordination
- Coordinates text + attachment messages
- Proper context building for flows
- Username resolution framework
- Image attachment processing framework

## 🔄 How It Works

### New User Journey
```
1. User: "hey"
2. System: Detects new user → Routes to OnboardingFlow
3. Bot: "gmeow! looks like you're new here. to help you get started..."
4. User provides coin name, ticker, image
5. User provides usernames: "@alice, @bob, charlie.eth"
6. System resolves addresses and launches coin
7. User becomes active with complete group setup
```

### Active User Experience
```
1. User: "show my coins" → Routes to ManagementFlow
2. User: "how do trading fees work?" → Routes to QAFlow
3. User: "add new coin" → Routes to ManagementFlow
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### Start the New Architecture
```bash
# Development mode with auto-restart
yarn dev:new

# Or production mode
yarn start:new
```

### Testing Flow
1. Send a message from a new user → Should trigger onboarding
2. Follow the 2-step onboarding process
3. Test management commands: "show coins", "show groups"
4. Test Q&A: Ask questions about groups, fees, etc.

## 🔮 Next Steps (Future Implementation)

### Phase 2: @flaunch/sdk Integration
- [ ] Replace `simulateLaunch()` with actual SDK calls
- [ ] Implement `flaunchWrite.flaunchIPFSWithSplitManager()`

- [ ] Real image processing and IPFS upload

### Phase 3: Knowledge Base
- [ ] Implement vector embeddings for Q&A
- [ ] Add knowledge base loader
- [ ] Context-aware responses

### Phase 4: API Integration
- [ ] User data API for existing coins/groups
- [ ] Real-time coin performance data
- [ ] Group member management

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Multiple groups per user
- [ ] Staking split groups
- [ ] Advanced fee management
- [ ] Group governance features
