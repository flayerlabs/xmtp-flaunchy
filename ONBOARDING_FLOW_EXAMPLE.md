# Onboarding Flow Implementation Example

## ðŸŽ¬ Complete User Journey

### Initial Contact - New User Detection
```
User: "hey"
Bot: "gmeow! looks like you're new here. to help you get started, i need to set up your first Group and launch a coin for it.

to get started we need to launch a coin for your Group. i need a name, ticker and image. you can add more coins later on and all trading fees will be shared with Group members.

what's the name of your coin?"

State: { status: 'onboarding', step: 'coin_creation', coinData: {} }
```

### Step 1: Coin Creation Flow
```
User: "FluffyCoin"
Bot: "nice! FluffyCoin it is. now i need a ticker symbol (like BTC or ETH) - what ticker do you want for FluffyCoin?"

State: { status: 'onboarding', step: 'coin_creation', coinData: { name: 'FluffyCoin' } }
```

```
User: "FLUFF"
Bot: "perfect! FLUFF is a solid ticker. now i need an image for your coin. you can either send me an image or provide a URL to one."

State: { status: 'onboarding', step: 'coin_creation', coinData: { name: 'FluffyCoin', ticker: 'FLUFF' } }
```

```
User: [sends image attachment]
Bot: "got your image! working on processing it...
uploading to ipfs now...

great! now i have everything for your FLUFF coin. moving to step 2...

now i need the usernames or addresses of the people you want to split trading fees with. you can provide:
- farcaster usernames (like @alice)
- ENS names (like alice.eth)  
- ethereum addresses (like 0x123...)

just list them separated by commas. if you want custom fee percentages, add them like: @alice 30%, @bob 70%
otherwise they'll be split equally among everyone."

State: { 
  status: 'onboarding', 
  step: 'username_collection', 
  coinData: { name: 'FluffyCoin', ticker: 'FLUFF', image: 'ipfs://...' } 
}
```

### Step 2: Username Collection
```
User: "@alice, @bob, charlie.eth"
Bot: "got it! i'll set up equal splits for:
- @alice
- @bob  
- charlie.eth
- you (as creator)

resolving addresses..."

[Resolves usernames to addresses]

Bot: "addresses resolved successfully:
- @alice -> 0x123...abc
- @bob -> 0x456...def
- charlie.eth -> 0x789...ghi

each person will get 25% of trading fees (equal split).

launching your FLUFF coin now with @flaunch/sdk..."

[Calls flaunchWrite.flaunchIPFSWithSplitManager]

Bot: "boom! your FLUFF coin is launching ðŸŽ‰

coin details:
- name: FluffyCoin (FLUFF)
- fair launch: 30 minutes, 40% supply
- starting market cap: $1,000
- fee split: 25% each among 4 members
- creator fee allocation: 100%

your Group is ready! here's what you can do:
- add more coins to your group
- check your group's performance  
- ask me questions about managing your group

fair launch starts now - stay flaunchy!"

State: { 
  status: 'active', 
  onboardingProgress: { completed: true },
  groups: [{ id: 'group_123', type: 'username_split', receivers: [...] }],
  coins: [{ ticker: 'FLUFF', groupId: 'group_123', launched: true }]
}
```

### Alternative: Custom Percentages
```
User: "@alice 40%, @bob 30%, charlie.eth 20%"
Bot: "got it! custom fee splits:
- @alice: 40%
- @bob: 30%
- charlie.eth: 20%
- you (creator): 10% (remaining)

total: 100% âœ“

resolving addresses and launching..."

[Same resolution and launch process]

## ðŸ§  Knowledge Base Q&A Examples

### After Onboarding - Q&A Flow
```
User: "how do trading fees work?"
Bot: "trading fees are 1% on both buys and sells. since you set up a username split group, fees are distributed equally among all group members.

for your FLUFF coin specifically:
- 80% of fees go to your group members (split equally)
- 20% goes to automated buybacks for price support

want to know more about fee distribution or automated buybacks?"

Context: Uses knowledge base + user's specific group type
```

```
User: "can i add another coin to my group?"
Bot: "absolutely! you can add unlimited coins to your existing group. all trading fees from new coins will also be split among your group members.

want me to help you launch another coin right now?"

Context: References user's current group setup
```

```
User: "show me my coins"
Bot: [Calls API to fetch user's coins]
"here are your coins:

ðŸª™ FluffyCoin (FLUFF)
- launched: 2 hours ago
- group: your username split group
- fair launch: active (28 minutes remaining)
- current price: $10,000 market cap
- your share of fees: equal split with 3 other members

want details on any specific coin or ready to launch another?"

Context: Live API data + user's specific situation
```

## ðŸ”Œ Integration Points

### State Persistence
```typescript
// SQLite/PostgreSQL schema
CREATE TABLE user_states (
  user_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  onboarding_progress JSON,
  coins JSON,
  groups JSON,
  preferences JSON,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Integration
```typescript
interface UserDataApi {
  async getUserCoins(userId: string): Promise<{
    ticker: string;
    name: string;
    groupId: string;
    launchTime: Date;
    currentPrice: number;
    fairLaunchStatus: 'active' | 'completed';
    timeRemaining?: number;
  }[]>;
  
  async getUserGroups(userId: string): Promise<{
    id: string;
    type: 'username_split' | 'staking_split';
    memberCount: number;
    totalFees: number;
    coins: string[];
  }[]>;
}
```

This implementation provides a complete, conversation-driven onboarding experience that guides users through coin creation and group setup while maintaining state and enabling seamless transitions to ongoing management and Q&A functionality.
